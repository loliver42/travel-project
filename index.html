            <h2>Why New York City?</h2>
            <h3>New York City, New York</h3>
            <p>
              New York, often called New York City or simply NYC, is the most
              populous city in the United States, located at the southern tip of
              New York State on one of the world's largest natural harbors. The
              city comprises five boroughs, each of which is coextensive with a
              respective county. It is a global city and a cultural, financial,
              high-tech, entertainment, and media center with a significant
              influence on commerce, health care, scientific output, life
              sciences, research, technology, education, politics, tourism,
              dining, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the
              United Nations, New York is an important center for international
              diplomacy, and is sometimes described as the world's most
              important city and the capital of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              With an estimated population in 2022 of 8,335,897 distributed over
              300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), the city is the most densely
              populated major city in the United States. New York has more than
              double the population of Los Angeles, the nation's second-most
              populous city. New York is the geographical and demographic center
              of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan
              area, the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. by both population
              and urban area. With more than 20.1 million people in its
              metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined
              statistical area as of 2020, New York City is one of the world's
              most populous megacities. The city and its metropolitan area are
              the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As
              many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most
              linguistically diverse city in the world. In 2021, the city was
              home to nearly 3.1 million residents born outside the U.S., the
              largest foreign-born population of any city in the world.

                <p>
                  Since its beginning in 1892, the spirit has changed very
                  little. Ferrara is a family owned business operated by the
                  fifth generation. That is perhaps the most wonderful thing
                  about Ferrara.

                  Founded in 1983 in the East Village, Cafe Mogador was both an
                  early pioneer in the NYC restaurant world and a downtown
                  cultural hub. From expertly braised tagines and house-made
                  bread, to an award-winning brunch served alongside some of the
                  best people-watching in the city, the restaurant continues to
                  proudly grow with the neighborhoods it's helped create.
